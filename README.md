Urbanary is an AI-powered project developed by Avijeet Paul with the goal of enhancing the way people explore their cities. The platform leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized recommendations for local experiences, ranging from cultural events and hidden landmarks to restaurants and community spaces.

The project is designed to move beyond generic guides and tourist hotspots, offering insights that make exploration more meaningful and context-aware. By combining modern AI/ML techniques with map data and local datasets, Urbanary creates a smarter and more intuitive way to connect with the city around you.

As an open-source initiative, Urbanary welcomes contributions from developers, designers, and city enthusiasts who share the vision of redefining urban exploration. The project is licensed under the MIT License, ensuring freedom to use, modify, and expand upon the work.
